A small simple helper program, intended for exam random questions / quickfire round practice.

At present, includes a Unity-made windowed application, with all topics from the 'dartboards' of my own class' class subjects.
Click the button to get a random new topic (which of course won't pull the same as the current).

It was made during the holiday period, in-between the conclusion of the first year and the start of the following, second year.
